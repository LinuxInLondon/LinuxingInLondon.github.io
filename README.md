mkdir Linuxing – the Linuxing In London's newsletter issue 0.

\

1.  

\

Welcome to the first edition of our newsletter. We are aimed squarely at
popularising the use of technology, open source and Linux and as a
result our content is very varied, not just plain old Linux or BSD.

\

This newsletter contains links we thought might be useful to members of
our MeetUp group.

\

It provides a wide sampling of technology and events. We don’t believe
that technology should be confined to a few aficionados or those in the
know and our newsletter reflects that.

\

If you have attended one of our meetings you’ll know we like freebies,
this newsletter is no exception. Some of the events include discount
codes, please use them!

\

The format of this newsletter is somewhat experimental.

\

There is a section for Jobs towards the end. We will include in a
Wanted/Recycling section if there is demand.

\

If you’ve never been to a Pi Jam before I would recommend the East
London Raspberry Jam, it is free and organised by
[Nic](https://twitter.com/duck_star)[](https://twitter.com/duck_star)[Hughes](https://twitter.com/duck_star)[.](https://twitter.com/duck_star)

\

\

**Hint:** Linuxing In London are looking for volunteers to help out, and
if possible a (free) designer for our Github-hosted web site. So if you
fancy being artistic with Jekyll please contact Brian or
[David](https://about.me/thedavidross)[.](https://about.me/thedavidross)

\

Enjoy!

5.  

\

It has been some 25 years since a young Finnish student posted a simple
comment on the minix Usenet group. Now Linux exists everywhere, at
Google, Facebook, Mozilla and tens of thousands of other organisation.
Even at Microsoft!

\

Linus has won, but more importantly, it opened up a new culture in
computing. A non-elitist ethos where everyone can potentially
participate, if they have the will, the energy and that initial
technology.

\

Getting people to use old laptops in developing countries is one of the
best projects that could exist. It shows students, poor kids, and
everyone else that you just need perseverance and a good idea.

\

The advent of Raspberry Pi has opened up a new world for children,
creativity is not merely confined to those with the most expensive
hardware.

\

Linux has played a crucial role in democratising access to technology,
but so much more to be done.

\

And you can play your part too!

\

Help your relatives, friends and colleagues reuse of those old laptops
(often consigned to the bottom of the cupboard after they’ve ground to a
halt or been infected with numerous viruses). Encourage people to reuse
technology, to give it a new lease of life.

\

Install Linux everywhere on everything, and you will make me a very
happy old man.

Brian has asked me to put my stamp on this newsletter too. I can't do so
without very briefly describing how Linux got me here today.

\

In the relatively short period of time (2008) I've been using Linux I've
switched from GUI distros (Ubuntu 8/Hardy Heron, Fedora 9/Sulphur), to
the minimal (Crunchbang 10, BunsenLabs Hydrogen, Debian Jessie), and
more recently settling on something I feel is wedged in between and
brings a little colour back into my life (Manjaro LXQt).

\

It was only through using an indestructible Netbook that was struggling
with the heavy GUI I tested a swathe of flavours. Getting rid of Windows
7 was something done one day one, and I little desire to head back that
restoring route. I made the mistake of thinking I could look at the
entire list on Distrowatch and find the one that looked the best. Yes I
survived going down that rabbit hole.

\

Ultimately I began to switch from simply using Linux, to exploring
through my use. Through its minimal interface the design of Crunchbang
(and the later community branch BunsenLabs) forced you to interact with
OpenBox and the command line. The excellent documentation encouraged you
to learn some basic scripting to edit the distro precisely to your
liking. To get comfortable using terminal.

\

I'm forever indebted to Crunchbang's creator Philip Newborough in
capturing my passion for Linux and I think I'll always tweak things so
they're that little bit greyer.

Not sure about xz files? Use tar xvfJ file.tar.xz or install xz-utils
and use unxz

\

Lost your swap file? Try cat /proc/swaps

\

Worried about performance? Use glances and dstat

The role of women in technology is often downplayed despite being 51% of
the population. We hear little of the immense achievements of Hedy
Lamarr, Ada Lovelace or Margaret Hamilton. Hedy Lamarr invented spread
spectrum technology, used every day in modern Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth
([cnet](http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/happy-100th-birthday-hedy-lamarr-movie-star-and-wi-fi-inventor/)[.](http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/happy-100th-birthday-hedy-lamarr-movie-star-and-wi-fi-inventor/)[com](http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/happy-100th-birthday-hedy-lamarr-movie-star-and-wi-fi-inventor/)).

Ada Lovelace is considered to be the world’s first programmer
([biographer](http://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323#babbage-and-the-analytical-engine)[.](http://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323#babbage-and-the-analytical-engine)[com](http://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323#babbage-and-the-analytical-engine)).
Margaret Hamilton’s coding skills probably saved NASA’s Apollo
11([wired](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/)[.](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/)[com](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/)).

In recent years there has been a change, an increasing desire to counter
the gender imbalance in technological circles with the advent of STEM.
These are just a few of the many excellent MeetUps in and around London:

We are very keen to hear from any women speakers, particularly around
Linux, BSD or Open Source. Please contact Brian or David.

Onto the fun stuff I've checked out this month.

\

We forgot the cake. Yes we know we forgot the Linux 25th birthday cake
at the August Meetup. You don't know how much I love cake, so even
writing this hurts. But we're all adults. It's the past now.

\

Maidsafe hit Alpha release. It's a decentralised file platform. It's
different because it encrypts by default and you'll earn Safecoins by
contributing to the source code or helping improve the network.
Conceptually it's really ace, but it's taken quite some time to get to
this point, and forums are not short on people airing that opinion.
Alpha release has work on building and hosting your website, storing
private data, and sharing public data. I've got quite excited by the
browser some members of the community are knocking together. As it's
still growing I've found it a nice ethical project to wrap my head
around. Check them out at https://maidsafe.net and the community forum
at https://safenetforum.org/

\

The best way to become a \*great\* programmer is to reverse engineer the
stuff you like. Not only was this the best advice I've ever had from a
15 year old who knows 15 computer languages, it was recently backed up
by a software engineer at Product Hunt. I think I really need to start
doing this and will let you know how I get on at the September Meetup.

I'll leave you with this little nugget some of you may have missed. In
case you were not aware, we love our penguins at Linuxing in London. And
it seems Edinburgh Zoo love their penguins so much they gave one a
medal.
