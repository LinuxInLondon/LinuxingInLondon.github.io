If you need to convert a standard LibreOffice or RTF document into markdown format for Github there are various ways

You could use pandoc, unoconv or similar.

But experience has taught me that they are less than perfect.

The easiest approach is to upload to Google docs and then use a macro to convert to Markdown.

It is not 100%, particularly on the section headers, but overall it works better than most solutions.
